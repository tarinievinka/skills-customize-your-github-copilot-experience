# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and understand basic API concepts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Simple REST API

#### Description
Build a FastAPI application that manages a collection of books. The API should allow users to view, add, update, and delete books from the collection.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

  - List all books (GET)
  - Add a new book (POST)
  - Update an existing book (PUT)
  - Delete a book (DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses
- Include clear instructions for running and testing the API

### 🛠️ (Optional) Add Validation and Error Handling
